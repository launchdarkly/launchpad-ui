# Figma File Layout Selector

This recipe demonstrates how to create a comprehensive interface for selecting and previewing different Figma file layouts using the LaunchPad design system. It showcases the integration between Figma designs and React components through Code Connect mappings.

## Key Features

- **Layout Selection Interface**: Browse and select from different layout patterns
- **Real-time Preview**: See live previews of selected layouts with actual components
- **Component Mapping**: Demonstrates how Figma design properties map to React component props
- **Interactive Demo**: Multiple story variants showing different use cases

## Components Used

- `GridList` & `GridListItem` - For layout option lists and data grids
- `Select` & `ListBox` - For category filtering and dropdown selections
- `Button` & `ButtonGroup` - For actions and layout switching
- `Alert` - For status messages and notifications
- `Modal` & `Dialog` - For detailed component mapping information
- `Tooltip` - For helpful context and descriptions
- `Avatar` - For user representation in navigation layouts
- `Heading` & `Text` - For content hierarchy and descriptions

## Code Connect Integration

This recipe references the actual `figma.tsx` files in the design system to ensure accurate component mapping:

- **Button.figma.tsx**: Maps Figma button variants to React props
- **Alert.figma.tsx**: Maps Figma alert states to status props
- **Modal.figma.tsx**: Maps Figma modal sizes to component breakpoints
- **Select.figma.tsx**: Maps Figma dropdown styles to component variants

## Usage

The recipe provides three main story variants:

1. **Figma File Layout Selector**: Complete interface with layout browser and preview
2. **Interactive Layout Switcher**: Simplified button-based layout switching
3. **Component Mapping Demo**: Modal demonstrating Figma-to-code mapping

Each variant showcases different aspects of working with Figma-connected components in a real application context.
