## Installation

```sh
$ yarn add @launchpad-ui/core
# or
$ npm install @launchpad-ui/core
```

## Usage

First, import the CSS variable tokens into your project:

```css
@import '@launchpad-ui/tokens/dist/index.css';
@import '@launchpad-ui/tokens/dist/media-queries.css';
```

Voil√†, you can now begin using any of the components available in LaunchPad. For the full list, view [our Storybook](https://main--626696a2018c1f004a1cde86.chromatic.com/?path=/story/components-alert--success).

```jsx
import { Alert, AlertKind } from '@launchpad-ui/core';

...

return (
  <Alert kind={AlertKind.ERROR}>
    An unexpected error occurred.
  </Alert>
)
```

### Importing stylesheets

In some frameworks, such as Remix, adding styles via `<link rel="stylesheet">` tags is the preferred approach. In LaunchPad, we expose each component's stylesheets so you can import them directly. For a Remix example, [click here](https://github.com/launchdarkly/launchpad-ui/blob/main/apps/remix/app/root.tsx#L41).

## FAQs

### Should I import each component package separately, or import everything at once via the `core` package?

To guarantee strict compatibility between the component packages your app uses, we suggest importing `@launchpad-ui/core` instead of importing each component package separately.

If you choose to use LaunchPad via single component imports (e.g. `@launchpad-ui/button`) on its own, there are two things to be aware of:

1. You may create token conflicts that expose difficult to diagnose bugs [as described here.](https://launchdarkly.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENG/pages/2120908865/Supporting+a+Single+NPM+Package+for+LaunchPad#Token-package-conflicts)
2. You may create inconsistencies in UI styling where subdependencies are used in components [as shown here.](https://launchdarkly.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENG/pages/2120908865/Supporting+a+Single+NPM+Package+for+LaunchPad#Subdependency-package-conflicts)

### Can I test pre-release versions of components?

To feature flag and test a pre-release version of a component, first install the pre-release using an alias:

```sh
$ yarn add @launchpad-ui/alert-beta@npm:@launchpad-ui/alert@0.10.0-beta.0
```

Then import and use the pre-release version alongside the version from `core`:

```jsx
import { Alert, AlertKind } from '@launchpad-ui/core';
import { Alert as BetaAlert } from '@launchpad-ui/alert-beta';

...

if (enableNewAlert()) {
  return (
    <BetaAlert>...</BetaAlert>
  );
}

return (
  <Alert kind={AlertKind.ERROR}>
    An unexpected error occurred.
  </Alert>
)
```
